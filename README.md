# Placement-Predictor
Placement-Predictor is a machine learning model that predicts the placement outcome of students based on their IQ and CGPA, using logistic regression as the modeling approach. This model is built using a placement dataset that includes information about the IQ, CGPA, and placement outcome (placed or not placed) of students from previous years.
